Exposes libdeflate compress and CRC32 API functions.

The wapper is in safe managed code in one class. No need external dll except libdeflate_x86.dll and libdeflate_x64.dll (included v0.8). The wrapper work in 32, 64 bit or ANY (auto swith to the apropiate library).

The code is full comented and include simple example for using the wrapper.
## Compress file functions

```

## Use
LittleZip can:
- Compress several files in a very little zip
- Compress in very little time
- Use very little code
- Very little learning for use

LittleZip can not:
- Create a large zip (> 2.147.483.647 bytes)
- Store a large file (> 2.147.483.647 bytes)
- Use little memory (need two times the compresed file)
- Decompress one ZIP file, erase files in zip, update files in zip, test files in zip. For this purpose, use http://github.com/jaime-olivares/zipstorer
